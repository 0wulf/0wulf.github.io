# How hacking has made me a better software engineer
I've been member of Security UC Club for almost a year now, and since I took the decision to learn about hacking, I've learned a lot of things that have helped me become a better software engineer.
Here I'll discuss some of the attacks and tools I've learned and how this things could help you too.

The most common tool to use in web exploitation is the Dev tools or similar in your browser. This ...
