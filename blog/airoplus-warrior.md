# Airoplus Warrior USB WiFi Dongle WAR-2450-150N
This USB WiFi dongle uses the Ralink RT-3070L chipset. This chipset allows me to inject packets in the air for executing e.g. a replay attack.

I want to connect it to the [Mango Pi MQ-Pro](blog/mangopimqpro.md), in my road to a Mango Pi MQ-Pro cyberdeck. For this, I investigated a lot about kernel modules for device drivers and started writing code for the device. Little did I know that this would be very difficult considering that I was going to need to talk to the firmware, but it was my only choice because the driver wasn't ported yet (fake, it was but i didn't knew how to look for it). While looking into the kernel source, I realized that the RT2x00 modules were indeed in the RISC-V linux kernel source code, but it wasn't enabled by [sehraf's d1-riscv-arch-image-builder](https://github.com/sehraf/d1-riscv-arch-image-builder) script. So, obviously, I modified the scripts and included the kernel configurations for that. Then, I was able to get the RT2x00 kernel module inside the build. It worked. At that ppoint, I was a step closer to the Mango Pi MQ-Pro cyberdeck.
