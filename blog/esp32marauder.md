# Installing ESP32 Marauder in an ESP32 + TTF display
I recently received an ESP32, which I used for a while for playing with it and testing its capabilities. Surfing the web, I found a project called ESP32 Marauder, which is an ESP32 project that lets you do a lot of WiFi penetration testing and hacking. I decided to install it in my ESP32 and see how it works. In a few hours I was able to have a functional ESP32 Marauder, but it was a little bit tedious to manipulate, as it needed to be controlled by a serial terminal due to my lack of a TTF display. 

I decided to buy a display. In Aliexpress, I found this [ESP32+TTF display device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006604267846.html), which costed me only 2 bucks!!

I received it in less than two weeks. Currently I am working on this project. I will keep you updated on my progress.
