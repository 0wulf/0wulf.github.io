# Welcome
<h1> Welcome to my blog page </h1>
<p> Here i publish stuff i've been working on, probably less frequent as i would like to, but i'll do what i can. </p>
<p> Sit, read and relax with this blog entries talking about OS, networking, embedded programming, cybersecurity, etc. </p>
<p> I'm not an expert in any of these topics, but you can join me in my learning journey through this blog. </p>
<p> I hope you enjoy it! </p>
