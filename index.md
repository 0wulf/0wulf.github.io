# index :: README.md

Here i publish stuff i've been working on, probably less frequent as i would like to, but i'll do what i can.

So go ahead, read and relax with this blog entries talking about OS, networking, embedded programming, cybersecurity, etc.

I'm not an expert in any of these topics, but you can join me in my learning journey through this blog.

I hope you enjoy it!
