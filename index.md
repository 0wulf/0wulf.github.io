Here I publish about stuff I've been working on, probably less frequently than I would like to, but I'll do what I can. 

So go ahead, read and relax with these blog entries talking about OS, networking, embedded programming, cybersecurity, etc. 

I'm not an expert in any of these topics, but you can join me in my learning journey through this blog. 

I hope you enjoy it!
